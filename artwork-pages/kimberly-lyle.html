      <p><em>handling errors</em> uses error-handling vocabulary from several programming languages, translated into spoken dialogue. the work consists of audio recordings in which two people attempt to communicate using only these words – terms designed to anticipate, detect, and resolve mistakes in code.<br><br>
      the project originates from lyle's first programming class, where she encountered the concept of "error handling," a function intended to prevent programs from crashing. in this system, language can never fail. but what does it mean for a language to allow no errors or no space for misinterpretation, contradiction, or feeling?<br><br>
      by imposing this vocabulary onto human speech, the work collapses the distance between machine logic and human communication, reintroduces human uncertainty, and reclaims error as a form of meaning. </p>
