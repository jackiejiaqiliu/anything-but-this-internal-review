      <h1>i did not expect an answer</h1>
      <h2>inkjet print on transparency film<br>
      7'' x 7''<br>
      2025</h2>
      <p><em>i did not expect an answer</em> reflects on huan's experience of using chatgpt as a free therapist. the artist shared traumas, doubts, and questions with the program, which never showed true understanding. over time, she realized that what mattered was not the response but the act of asking. <br><br>
      The work takes the form of a 7'' × 7'' handwoven transparency film, composed of printed fragments from these unanswered questions. The handweaving process brings calm, meditation, and repair, while its grid structure echoes algorithmic logic. in the absence of AI's understanding, a different kind of presence emerges — one where self-reflection becomes tangible, woven into material form. </p>
      <h3>artist: qinyu echo huan</h3>
      <p>qinyu echo huan (b.1997, beijing, china) is a multidisciplinary artist working at the intersection of fiber, painting, installation, and digital media. her work is rooted in personal narrative and childhood memories. she approaches her practice as a therapeutic exploration of identity and self-awareness. she focuses on the characteristics of ready-made materials, transforming them into abstract forms and structures to express subtle emotions and tensions. <br><br>
      based in chicago, echo is pursuing an mfa at the school of the art institute with the visionary scholars award and the lenore g. tawney foundation scholarship. her works have been exhibited at the kresge art center, (mi, us), (scene) metrospace (mi, us), lan gallery (beijing, china), saic galleries (il, us)</p>
