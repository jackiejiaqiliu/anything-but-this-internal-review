      <p><em>how i become a punch card</em> sets up a speculative stage where a modern computer communicates with its most primitive form, a weaving loom, through the brain and body of a human acting as both compiler and loom operator. highlighting the word "punch card" in the title, the work recalls the early nineteenth-century jacquard loom, which processed man-made punch cards to achieve sequences of automated operations.<br><br>
      in this installation, the computer creates patterns and transmits binary digits, along with weaving instructions, to a human processor for the final woven outcome. by situating a person as an inseparable component of this computational process, <em>how i become a punch card</em> becomes a metaphor for daily life in the information age, where human subjectivity is constantly negotiated with the agency of the machine.<br><br>
      one continuous textile forms over time, serving as both a physical and metaphorical record of computation. each thread traces the intertwined evolution of weaving and thinking machines, from our first attempt to mechanize craft to the emergence of autonomous intelligence modeled on the human brain.</p>
