      2024</h2>
      <p><em>training (for) a possible application</em> poses a speculative question: how would artificial intelligence need to be trained to exist not just as software, but as a presence in the physical world? it would have to learn the rules that already govern us. the video observes how machines, devices, and signs structure daily life through repetition and regulation—where routines unfold like code, decisions are automated, and the margin for error grows ever narrower.<br><br>
      filmed in beijing on low-resolution minidv tapes in 2024, the footage bears the visible traces of its medium—glitches, compression artifacts, and mechanical irregularities—that introduce chance into an otherwise rule-bound world.</p>
      <h3>artist: dirk sorge</h3>
      <p>dirk sorge is a visual artist based in leipzig and berlin. he studied visual arts at the udk berlin and philosophy at the tu berlin. his works include videos, installations, performances, and computer programs. his way of working is conceptual and often research-based, e.g. with reference to museum collections or scientific questions. he is interested in the interweaving of (digital) technology, image production and world making. recurring themes are automation, standardization, irrationality and hierarchization. rule-based systems are often used to make aesthetic decisions and to question the idea of authorship. as an artist with a visual disability, some works are informed by his activism against ableist structures.</p>
